ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Thanks to:

    Brian Helterline for help in solving 6x6 puzzles and making this more
    configurable.

    Jean-Pierre Vidal for providing puzzles that the previous version could
    not solve.

    Eugene Kulesha (<http://search.cpan.org/~jset/>) for providing a test
    that I could not initially pass and for the idea of keeping test data in
    data files rather than in the tests themselves.

    Tom Wyant (<http://search.cpan.org/~wyant/>)) for the idea of using dots
    rather than spaces to represent unknowns in the text representation of
    the board.
