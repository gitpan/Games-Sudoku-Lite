ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Thanks to Tom Wyant (<http://search.cpan.org/~wyant/>)) for the idea of
    using dots rather than spaces to represent unknowns in the text
    representation of the board.

    Thanks to Eugene Kulesha (<http://search.cpan.org/~jset/>) for providing
    a test that I could not initially pass and for the idea of keeping test
    data in data files rather than in the tests themselves.
